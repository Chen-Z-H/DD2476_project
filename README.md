### Index the data to elasticsearch

This simple search engine can only apply to the specific strutures of the data of articles and the users.
So before you run the program, you need make sure that the data have the following structures.</br>
Structure of user:
```javascript
{
	"id": <id>, 
	"preferences": {<category1>: <hitcounts1>, <category2>: <hitcounts2>, ...}, 
	"search_history": {<query1>: [<docid1>, <docid2>, ...], ...}
}
```
Structure of article:
```javascript
{
    "name" : <name>,
    "id" : <value>,
    "text" : <article text>,
    "categories" = [
        <cat1>, <cat2>, <cat3> ...
    ]
}
```
Run the following command to create a record of user with id 5:
```
curl -XPOST 'http://localhost:9200/users/user/5' -H'Content-Type: application/json' -d'
{
	"id":5, 
	"preferences": {}, 
	"search_history": {}
}'
```
Our original data of articles is too large to push on github, but you can use any data that have the format above.

If you already have indices called 'articles' and 'users', you may need to delete them with the following commands before indexing new data:
```
curl -XDELETE 'localhost:9200/articles'  // Delete the index of articles
```
```
curl -XDELETE 'localhost:9200/users'  // Delete the index of users
```

### Running
Make sure you start the elasticsearch server before you run the search engine.
Run the following command to launch the GUI:
```
python se_main.py
```
